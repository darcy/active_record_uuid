h2. What is this?

This plugin adds auto-generated UUIDs to ActiveRecord models. 

To add this capability to existing models:

<pre><code>
  class AddUuidToInvites < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      change_table :invites do |t|
        t.uuid
      end
    end
</code></pre>

To set it up when creating new tables:

<pre><code>
  class CreatePeople < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :people do |t|
        t.string :name
        t.uuid
      end
    end
</code></pre>

When your record is created, it'll have a UUID, accessible via the 'uuid' attribute.

h2. Todo

* The generate_uuids! migration helper seems not to work, possibly because the uuid attribute is read-only.
* Test cases failed to catch the above.
* Addition of index in uuid migration is broken. See commit 697a2f7b02681b03ef1f7624f58ea19a622b3a32.
